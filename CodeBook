Goal is to prepare a tidy data set derived from information from experiments 
executed by a group of 30 volunteers within the age bracket of 19-48 years
performing six activities : walking, walking_upstaits, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, laying
while their motion is being sensored by wearing a smartphone

The final result is a subset of the initial information found in the zip file created with the result of the above described experiment
(https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The following files are used to define the final result or serve as input to get a view on the information contained within those files :
- features.txt : labels indicating the different measurements resulting from every activity performed by every volunteer
- activity_labels : labels of the different activities (measurements files only contain a number)
- train/X-train.txt : actual measurements registered for every activity performed by every volunteer
- train/subject_train : link between volunteers and measurements registered in previous file
- test/x_train.txt : measurements registered for every activity performed by every volunteer in test modus
- test/subject_test : link between volunteers and measurements registered in previous file
- README.txt : global introduction and overview of the executed experiments and the authors of the experiments 
- features_info.txt : explanation of the executed measurements with the applied principles

The final result contains the average 
per volunteer, per activity 
for the mean and standard deviation for each measurement contained within the initial measurement files
